Trying to create a new binary system to use Emoticons instead of 1's and 0's
//*/"This is the start of my project to create a binary code system to use Emoticons as the default TCP/IP protocols, and as a filing system naming convention//*/
##"This system will need to convert binary code to Font + .img file formatting removing the string values of the standard UTF-8/UTF-16 format."##
##"Unsure if this has already been accomplished or not, but am certain it has not been accomplished as when I name my file systems on my PC at home, general networking errors occur and are unable to read the output."##
##"Unsure of which Emoticon to utilize for the standard system icon that should be hidden"##
##"I am not a veteran programmer/coder as of yet, but am learning every chance I get!"##
##"Wondering if this is even something that can be accomplished, but generally knowing that if you can generate something with computer code, you can make it work."##
##"Any and all assistance with trying to get this accomplished would be much appreaciated. I tend to work better when collaborating directly with a professional who can guide me in the right direction. Please feel free to message me if you're interested in assisting me with this task.##
Thank you!
